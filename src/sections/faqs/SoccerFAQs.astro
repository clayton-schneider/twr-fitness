    question:
      "My son/daughter is interested in soccer lessons, do we meet at a field or at your studio?",
    answer:
      "We can run private lessons at a soccer field, at my studio, or even at your home! It depends on things like the weather, my schedule, and what we want to work on. Generally speaking most sessions will be run out of my studio and we can work on most things there.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What sort of equipment (shoes, shin guards, ball) should my son/daughter bring for private lessons?",
    answer:
      "If we are in the studio indoor soccer shoes or sneakers, if we are outside soccer cleats. Shin guards are not necessary however they are recommended for group lessons. I have everything else we would need.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you do group lessons, classes, or camps?",
    answer:
      "I do group lessons upon request. Right now TWR Fitness does not do official classes, camps, or larger programs.",

    question: "What ages/levels of experience do you work with?",

    question: "What is Tristan’s level of experience?",
    answer:
      "I have been playing soccer all of my life and coaching since 2018. Highest level played was semipro on a UPSL team. Soccer has been the most consistent passion for me and although I love playing I love coaching and teaching more. Since moving to Boston in 2022 I have been working with the New England Revolution and Steel United while also offering private lessons under my own name.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I drop my kids off for their lesson or should I stay?",
    answer:
      "It is up to you! Some parents drop off some prefer to stick around. I have no problem with or preference towards either.",
